setup.sh is the setup script for symlinks and submodules only. 
It does not install git, theme stuff or anything else,
nor does it set up ssh.

However, it does contain instructions for those steps.

arch.sh is an additional install script for Arch Linux installations.

new_install_guide will be a bash script which you can use to
(mostly) automate the setup of a nice setup on new installs for Ubuntu.
